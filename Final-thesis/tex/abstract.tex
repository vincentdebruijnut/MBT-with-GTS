\textit{Graph Grammars} describe system behavior through graphs and graph transformation rules. Graph Grammars have not been used for Model-Based Testing. However, Graph Grammars have many structural advantages, which are potential benefits for the model-based testing process. We describe a model-based testing setup with Graph Grammars. The result is a system for automatic test generation from Graph Grammars. A graph transformation tool, GROOVE, and a model-based testing tool using Symbolic Transition Systems, ATM, are used as the backbone of the system.

One result of this report is a tool, GRATiS, which can be used for model-based testing with Graph Grammars. This tool is shown to be useful for the model-based testing paradigm, i.a. by showing its effectiveness in several case studies. Another result of this report is a technique for the generation of a Symbolic Transition System from a Graph Grammar. Furthermore, a complexity difference is revealed between Graph Grammars and Symbolic Transition Systems: the first uses a bigger vocabulary and the latter uses more repetition to model the same behavior.
