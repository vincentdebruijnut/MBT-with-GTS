\textit{Graph Grammars} describe system behavior through graphs and graph transformation rules. Graph Grammars have not been used for Model-Based Testing. However, Graph Grammars have many structural advantages, which are potential benefits for the model-based testing process. We describe a model-based testing setup with Graph Grammars. The result is a system for automatic test generation from Graph Grammars. A graph transformation tool, GROOVE, and a model-based testing tool, ATM, are used as the backbone of the system. The system is validated using the results of several case studies.

The result of this report is a tool, GRATiS, which can be used for model-based testing on Graph Grammars.\marginpar{hier komt ook nog een kort overzicht van de conclusies}
