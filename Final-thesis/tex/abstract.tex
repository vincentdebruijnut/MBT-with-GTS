\textit{Graph Grammars} have many structural advantages, which are potential benefits for the model-based testing process. We describe a model-based testing setup with Graph Grammars. The result is a system for automatic test generation from Graph Grammars. A graph transformation tool, GROOVE, and a model-based testing tool, ATM, are used as the backbone of the system. The system is validated using the results of several case studies.
