This report describes the setup of a research project where the use of \textit{Graph Transformation Systems} (GTS) in model-based testing is researched. The goal of the project is to create a system for automatic test generation on GTSs and to validate this system. A graph transformation tool, GROOVE, and a model-based testing tool, ATM, are used as part of the system. The system will be validated using the results of several case-studies. GTSs have many structural advantages, which are potential benefits for the model-based testing process.
