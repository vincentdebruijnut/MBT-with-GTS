\section*{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}

First I would like to thank my supervisors: Arend Rensink, Marielle Stoelinga, Axel Belinfante and Machiel van der Bijl.
All the energy and time put into giving me feedback, helping me when I got stuck and pushing me to do better has been greatly appreciated.

I would like to thank my current employers at Axini B.V. for providing the opportunity to do this master thesis and for giving me ample time to finish it.

I would like to also thank my fellow final year students: Freark van den Berg, Harold Bruintjes, Ronald Burgman, Paul Stapersma, Gerjan Stokkink and Lesley Wevers. Even though we were not always productive, the discussions while drinking coffee or beer have been fun.

Finally, I would like to thank my parents for providing me with a distraction-free environment and food, so I could concentrate completely on my full-time job and finishing my master thesis.
