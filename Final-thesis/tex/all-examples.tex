\section{Example 1: boardgame}
The boardgame is the running example of which the IOSTS and IOGG are given in Figures~\ref{fig:example_sts} and \ref{fig:example_groove} respectively.

\subsection{Simulation and redundancy}
The responses used by the IOSTS and by the IOGG are different. Both models, used as examples to clarify the IOSTS and IOGG formalisms, were built with a different behavior in mind. Both allow a die to be thrown, after which the IOSTS directly moves the player to the correct location and passes the turn and the IOGG moves the player by a series of responses ended with a $!nextTurn$. Therefore, both IOSTSs do not simulate each other.

\subsection{Performance}
The IOSTS is generated in a runtime of 300 ms using a heap-size of 1.9 MB.

\subsection{Model complexity}
start:
13 distinct operands
1 distinct operator
33 operands
3 operators

move:
2 new distinct operands
5 new distinct operators
27 operands
6 operators

nextTurn:
0 new distinct operands
1 new distinct operator
13 operands
5 operators

throws:
3 new distinct operands
2 new distinct operators
30 operands
10 operators

$n_1 = 9, n_2 = 18, N_1 = 24, N_2 = 103$ Volume is 127*4.75 = 603.25

IOSTS:
22 distinct operands
5 distinct operators
62 operands
25 operators

$n_1 = 5, n_2 = 22, N_1 = 25, N_2 = 62$ Volume is 87*4.75 = 413.25


\subsection{Extendability}
The boardgame is extended to include more players and locations. For the IOGG, this means adding new locations and players to the initial graph. The players get a fixed order in which they play. This means that the next turn rule also has to be extended. The result is in Figure~\ref{fig:gg-bg-extended}. This extension reduces the distinct number of operators by 1 and introduces no new operands. The number of operator occurences has decreased by 1 and the number of operand occurences has grown by 10.

  \end{center}

\end{figure}

The IOSTS gains a variable and a switch relation for the new player. The result is in Figure~\ref{fig:sts-bg-extended}. The distinct number of operators has not increased and the distinct number of operands has increased by 1. The number of operator occurences has increased by 9 and the number of operand occurences has increased by 17.

The volume of the IOGG has increased by 35.95. $n_1 = 8, n_2 = 18, N_1 = 23, N_2 = 113$ Volume is 136*4.70 = 639.20
The volume of the IOSTS has increased by 130.28. $n_1 = 5, n_2 = 23, N_1 = 34, N_2 = 79$ Volume is 113*4.81 = 543.53


\section{Example 2: farmer-wolf-goat-cabbage}
In this puzzle, a farmer, wolf, goat and cabbage are on one side of a river. The farmer can take upto one object to the other side. If the wolf and goat are on one side of the river without the farmer, the wolf eats the goat and the puzzle is reset. This also holds for the goat and the cabbage. The goal is to move all four to the other side of the river. The IOGG of this puzzle is in Figure~\ref{fig:gg-fwgc}. Here the 'move' and 'invalid' rules are similar, therefore only the 'move cabbage' rule is shown. The response rules '!retry', '!eaten' and '!done' have a higher priority. This ensures that a proper response is given after a move, before allowing more stimuli. The IOSTS of this puzzle is in Figure~\ref{fig:sts-fwgc}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Simulation and redundancy}
Both the generated IOSTS and the IOSTS built by hand allow all inputs and give the appropriate responses when necessary. This shows that both IOSTSs simulate each other. The generated IOSTS has 50 switch relations and 0 location variables. The IOSTS built by hand has 11 switch relations and 4 location variables. The IOGG does not use variables to track the location of each item. Therefore the generated IOSTS has a location per state of the puzzle. 

\subsection{Performance}
The IOSTS is generated in a runtime of 770 ms using a heap-size of 5.2 MB.

\subsection{Model complexity}


\subsection{Extendability}
In another variant of this puzzle, when one of the objects is eaten, the puzzle does not reset but undoes the last action. Figure~\ref{fig:gg-fwgc-extended} shows this extension in two rules: the 'move cabbage' and the 'eaten undo' rule. The rules keep track of the last moved items. When an item gets eaten, the last move can be undone.

\section{Example 3: restaurant reservations}
Figure~\ref{fig:reservation_start} shows the initial graph of three tables at a restaurant and two potential customers. Figure~\ref{fig:make-reservation} shows part of a rule that allows people to make reservations. The start and end times are timestamps represented by integers. This rule allows people to make multiple reservations. However, this rule violates the constraint in section~\ref{sec:constraint-1}, because the reservation objects are not unique. Allowing a dynamic amount of reservations per person means that variables need to be introduced dynamically as well or more complex variables have to be used, such as arrays. To model this system using an IOSTS, arrays are also needed.

\section{Example 4: bar tab system}
This example models a bar tab system, where customers can order beer, wine and soda. The price of the order adds to tab. Customers can pay their tab with money; they receive cash back if the payment exceeds the tab. The model is abstracted to include three customers. Furthermore, a customer can order only one drink. Drinks and payments are processed immediately before other drinks or payments can occur. The stimuli accepted by the system are $?o(i,d), ?p(i,p)$ for ordering a drink $d$ on bar tab $i$ and paying amount $p$ on bar tab $i$ respectively. The responses by the system are $!po(b), !pp(b,r)$ for processing an order giving the new bar tab balance $b$ and processing a payment giving the new account balance $b$ and the return funds $r$ respectively.

Figure~\ref{fig:gg-bartab} shows the IOGG of the bar tab system. The '!process\_order' and '!process\_payment' rule have a higher priority than the '?order' and '?pay' rule. Figure~\ref{fig:sts-bartab} shows the IOSTS of the bar tab system. The IOSTS uses the variables $T_1, T_2, T_3$ to keep track of the bar tabs of the three people. It uses the variables $I, P$ as temporary variables for the id and payment/price respectively. The function $m$ takes the maximum value of its parameters.

  \label{fig:sts-bartab}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Simulation and redundancy}
Both the generated IOSTS and the IOSTS built by hand correctly allow the ordering of drinks and payment of bar tabs. This shows that both IOSTSs simulate each other. The generated IOSTS has 24 switch relations and 13 location variables. The IOSTS built by hand has 10 switch relations and 5 location variables. This shows that the generated IOSTSs is redundant. The first IOSTS keeps the name and price of drinks as location variables, whereas the latter IOSTS hard-codes these into the guards and updates. The generated IOSTS builds a switch relation with gate $?o$ for each combination of customer and drink. It also builds a switch relation with gate $?p$ for each customer. The target locations of all these switch relations have one switch relation back to the initial location. Therefore, the number of switch relations is $3*3*2+3*1*2 = 24$.

\subsection{Performance}
The IOSTS is generated in a runtime of 250 ms using a heap-size of 2.1 MB.

\subsection{Model complexity}


\subsection{Extendability}
The system is extended to allow ordering multiple drinks of different types. Also, a customer can purchase the option of receiving 10\% discount on all ordered drinks for 50 euros (added to the tab). The stimulus given is $?\mathit{d}$ and the response is $!pd(b)$ where $b$ is the new balance.

\section{Conclusions}
Need more complex data structures. And it is possible!
runtime and heap-size: negligible.
boardgame: different approaches in formalisms if requirements are not set. Note that abstract stimuli/responses are translated into non-abstract stimuli by Test Execution module. A response notifying player x has moved to location y can be translated to a serie of abstract responses. Advantage: allows model to be more flexible, have better design. Disadvantage: less clear according to specification, also more work in translating abstract stimuli/responses.
fwgc: 50 locations doable, no need to look at the generated STS. 11 switches and 4 variables easier visualized than 50 switches. Is this true?
bartab: more logical placement of concerns. tab is increased and deducted at the process rules, sts sets price of drink during ordering. IOGG uses OO by grouping names and prices and tabs and amounts.
