\section{Case study}\label{sec:case-study}

GRATiS is tested in a case study on a larger software system. The system is a \textit{self-scan register}, which allows customers of a supermarket to scan and pay for their products without influence of an employee. The system contains a \textit{scan-flow unit}, which scans the products, and a \textit{cash register unit}, which allows for the payment. The communication protocol between these two units is modelled as a GG, based on the specification of the system. This model is used for the model-based testing against the live system.
