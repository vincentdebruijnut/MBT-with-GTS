\section{Exploration strategy}

A GROOVE exploration strategy finds all graph states and rule matches.

\subsubsection{Isomorphism}
Isomorphism prevents correct tracking of location variables. Solve with sets.

\subsubsection{Eraser/creator pairs}
Location variables should be persistent and declared at the start state. Therefore, every eraser edge to a variable node should be paired with a creator edge. This edge should have the same source node and label.
