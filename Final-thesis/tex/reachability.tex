\subsection{Theory}
MSc thesis Floor Sietsma "A Case Study in Formal Testing and an Algorithm for Automatic Test Case Generation with Symbolic Transition Systems"

\subsection{Application}
Allows halting an exploration strategy when location no longer reachable. Only works for specific path though.
