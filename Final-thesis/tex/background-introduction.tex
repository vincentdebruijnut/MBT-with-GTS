The structure of the rest of this chapter is as follows: the general model-based testing process is set out in section \ref{sec:model_based_testing}. Some basic concepts from algebra are described in section~\ref{sec:algebra}. The symbolic models from ATM are then described in section \ref{sec:symbolic}. Section \ref{sec:graph} describes the graph grammar formalism. GROOVE and ATM are described in section \ref{sec:tooling}.
