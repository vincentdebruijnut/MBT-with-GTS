\section{Measurements}\label{sec:measurements}

This sections lists possible measurements on the models and execution of GRATiS on those models. For each measurement, a motivation is given for doing or not doing the measurement on the model examples and case study.

\subsection{Performance}
Performance in terms of execution time and 'heap-size' can be measured and compared.

\subsection{Simulation}
Does the transformation simulate the original STS? And vice versa?

\subsection{Error detection}
Introduce an error in model and see how fast GG and STS can find it. (mutation coverage)

\subsection{Coverage comparison}
Compare the Location/switch relation coverage of both the transformation and the original STS. Having a more complete STS is counter-beneficial here.

\subsection{Model complexity}
Halstead's software science op model complexity?

\subsection{Extendability}
Introduce a realistic scenario where functionality of the system is extended. Assess the needed changes to both models.
