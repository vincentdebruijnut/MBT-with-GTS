\section{Scanflow Cash Register Protocol}

The system used for this case study is a \textit{self-scan register}, which allows customers of a supermarket to scan and pay for their products without help of an employee. Figure~\ref{fig:register} shows this self-scan register. The system contains a \textit{scan-flow unit}, which scans the products, and a \textit{cash register unit}, which allows for the payment. The communication protocol between these two units is modelled as a GG, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:}.
