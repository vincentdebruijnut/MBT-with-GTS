\section{Graph Grammars}\label{sec:graph}
A \textit{graph grammar} is composed of a start graph and a set of transformation rules. The start graph describes the system in its initial state. The transformation rules describe what changes are made to the graph, resulting in a new graph which describes the system in its new state. The definition is as follows.
\vspace{5px}
\begin{definition}
A graph grammar is a tuple $\langle G, R\rangle$, where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $G$ is the start graph
  \item $R$ is a set of graph transformation rules
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

The rest of this section is ordered as follows: first, graphs and graph morphisms are explained. This is then used to explain graph transformation rules, followed by the definition of a graph grammar. Then, the definition of a \textit{Graph Transition System} (GTS) is given. An example of a graph grammar and a GTS is then given. Finally, a method for transforming a GTS to an STS is given. For a more detailed overview of graph grammars, we refer to~\cite{Rensink:graph_grammars, Heckel2006187, Andries1999}.

\subsection{Graphs \& morphisms}
\begin{definition}
A graph is a tuple $\langle L, N, E\rangle$, where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $L$ is a set of labels
  \item $N$ is a set of nodes, where each $n \in N$ has a label $l \in L$
  \item $E$ is a set of edges, where each $e \in E$ has a label $l \in L$ and nodes $source,target \in N$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

A graph $H$ has an \textit{occurrence} in a graph $G$, denoted by $H \rightarrow G$, if there is a mapping from the nodes and the edges of $H$ to the nodes and the edges of $G$ respectively. Such a mapping is called a \textit{morphism}. An element $e$ in graph $H$ is then said to have an \textit{image} in graph $G$ and $e$ is a \textit{pre-image} of the image. A graph $H$ has a partial morphism to a graph $G$ if there are elements in $H$ without an image in $G$.

\subsection{Graph transformation rules}\label{sec:graph_rules}
\begin{definition}
A transformation rule is a tuple $\langle \mathit{LHS}, \mathit{NAC}, \mathit{RHS}, \mathit{M}\rangle$, where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\mathit{LHS}$ is a graph representing the left-hand side of the rule
  \item $\mathit{NAC}$ is a set of graphs representing the negative application conditions
  \item $\mathit{RHS}$ is a graph representing the right-hand side of the rule
  \item $\mathit{M_{RHS}}$ is a partial morphism of $\mathit{LHS}$ to $\mathit{RHS}$ 
  \item $\mathit{M_{NAC}}$ are partial morphisms of $\mathit{LHS}$ to each $n \in \mathit{NAC}$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

A rule $R$ is applicable on a graph $G$ if its $\mathit{LHS}$ has an occurrence in $G$ and $\not\exists\,n \in \mathit{NAC}$ such that $n$ has an occurence in $G$ and $\forall\,e \in \mathit{LHS}$, if $e$ has an image $i$ in $n$, i.e. $(e \mapsto i) \in M_{NAC}$, and an image $j$ in $G$, then $j$ should be an image of $i$. This 'applicability' as defined here is refered to as a rule \textit{match}. After the rule match is applied to the graph, all elements in $\mathit{LHS}$ not part of $\mathit{M_{RHS}}$, i.e. they do not have an image in $\mathit{RHS}$, are removed from $G$ and all elements in $\mathit{RHS}$ not part of $\mathit{M_{RHS}}$, i.e. they do not have a pre-image in $\mathit{LHS}$, are added to $G$.

\subsection{Graph Transition Systems}
By repeatedly applying graph transformation rules to the start graph and all its consecutive graphs, a graph grammar can be explored to reveal a \textit{Graph Transition System} (GTS). This transition system consists of \textit{graph states} connected by \textit{rule transitions}.
\vspace{5px}
\begin{definition}
A graph transition system is an 8-tuple	$\langle S, L, T, G, R, M_G, M_R, s0\rangle$, where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $S$ is a finite, non-empty set of graph states
\item $L$ is a finite set of labels.
\item $T \in S \times (L \cup \{\tau\}) \times S$, with $\tau \notin L$, is the rule transition relation.
\item $G$ is a set of graphs.
\item $R$ is a set of rules.
\item $M_G$ is a mapping $\forall s \in S . s \mapsto g \in G \land \not\exists s' \in S . s \neq s' \land s' \mapsto g \in M_G$
\item $M_R$ is a mapping $\forall t \in T . t \mapsto r \in R \land \not\exists t' \in T . t \neq t' \land t' \mapsto r \in M_R$
\item $s0 \in s$ is the initial graph state.
\end{itemize}
We write $s \xrightarrow{\mu}s'$ if there is a rule transition labelled $\mu$ from state s to state s', i.e., $(s, \mu, s') \in T$.
\end{definition}

These systems are very similar to LTSs. A GTS can be transformed to an LTS by omitting the graphs, rules and mappings.

\subsection{Example}\label{sec:gts_example}
Figure \ref{fig:gts} shows an example of the start graph and one rule of a graph grammar. $\mathit{M_{RHS}}$ maps the $A$ and $B$ nodes in $\mathit{LHS}$ to the A and B nodes in $\mathit{RHS}$ respectively. $\mathit{M_{NAC}}$ maps the $A$ node in $\mathit{LHS}$ to the $A$ node in both graphs in $\mathit{NAC}$. The a-edge in $\mathit{LHS}$ is mapped to the a-edge in the first $\mathit{NAC}$. The $\mathit{LHS}$ of the rule has an occurrence in the start graph, as the $A$ and $B$ nodes connected by the a-edge exist in both graphs. None of the graphs in the $\mathit{NAC}$ have an occurrence in the start graph, because the $C$ node does not exist in the start graph. The new graph after applying the rule is in Figure~\ref{fig:gg_result}.

\subsection{Input-Output Graph Grammars}
In order to specify stimuli and responses with graph grammars, a definition is given for an \textit{Input-Output Graph Grammar} (IOGG). Concretely, the IOGG places input and output labels on its rule transitions. Following the definition from IOLTSs, each rule transition label $l \in L$ has a type $t \in T$, where $T = \{input, output\}$. Exploring an IOGG leads to an \textit{Input-Output Graph Transition System} (IOGTS).
