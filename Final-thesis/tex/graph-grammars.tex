\section{Graph Grammars}\label{sec:graph}
A \textit{Graph Grammar} (GG) is composed of a set of graph transformation rules. These rules indicate how a graph can be transformed to a new graph. These graphs are called \textit{host graphs}. The rules are composed of graphs themselves, which are called \textit{rule graphs}.

The rest of this section is ordered as follows: first, graphs, host graphs, rule graphs and graph transformation rules are explained. Then, the definition of a \textit{Graph Transition System} (GTS) is given. An example of a GG and a GTS is then given. Finally, the definition of IOGGs is given. For a more detailed overview of GGs, we refer to~\cite{Rensink:graph_grammars, Heckel2006187, Andries1999}.

\begin{definition}
A \textit{graph} is composed of nodes and edges. In this report, we assume a universe of nodes $\Nodes = \GraphNodes \uplus \mathbb{U} \uplus \Variables \uplus 2^\Terms$\newnot{symbol:Nodes}, where $\GraphNodes$\newnot{symbol:GraphNodes} is the universe of standard graph nodes. $\Edges$\newnot{symbol:Edges} is the universe of edges between two nodes in $\Nodes$.
\end{definition}

\vspace{5px}
\begin{definition}
A host graph $\hostGraph$ is a tuple $\langle \DefinedNodes, \DefinedEdges\rangle$\newnot{symbol:hostGraph}, where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\DefinedNodes \subseteq (\mathbb{W} \uplus \mathbb{U})$ is the node set of $\hostGraph$
  \item $\DefinedEdges \subseteq (\DefinedNodes\backslash\mathbb{U} \times \Labels \times \DefinedNodes)$ is the edge set of $\hostGraph$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\vspace{5px}

Figure~\ref{fig:hostgraph_example} shows an example of a host graph. Here, $n_1, n_2 \in \mathbb{W}$ are the \textit{identities} of the nodes. The other four nodes are values in $\mathbb{U}$.

\vspace{5px}
\begin{definition}
A rule graph $\ruleGraph$ is a tuple $\langle \DefinedRuleNodes, \DefinedRuleEdges \rangle$\newnot{symbol:ruleGraph}, where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\DefinedRuleNodes \subseteq (\Nodes \backslash \mathbb{U})$ is the node set of $\ruleGraph$
  \item $\DefinedRuleEdges \subseteq (\DefinedRuleNodes \times \Labels \times \DefinedRuleNodes)$ is the edge set of $\ruleGraph$
\end{itemize}
In addition, the following must hold:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\forall \node \in \DefinedRuleNodes \land \node \in 2^\Terms\: .\:\mathit{var}(\node) \subseteq \DefinedRuleNodes$ - The variables used in the terms must be present as nodes in the rule graph.
\item $(\forall \node \in \DefinedRuleNodes \land \node \in \Variables\: .\: \exists (\_, \_, \node) \in \DefinedRuleEdges$ - If a variable is used in a rule graph, it needs context. Therefore, there must be an edge with the variable node as target.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\vspace{5px}

Figure~\ref{fig:rulegraph_example} shows an example of a rule graph. Here, $r_1, r_2 \in \mathbb{W}$ are the node identities, $x_1,x_2 \in \Variables^{int}$ and $\{x_1+1, x_2\} \in 2^\Terms$. The set of terms is mapped as a node to the same value. This mapping is explained in the next definition. The consequence is that this node implicitly expresses the relation $x_1+1 = x_2$.

\begin{definition}
A graph $g$ has a \textit{morphism} to a graph $g'$ if there is a structure-preserving mapping from the nodes and the edges of $g$ to the nodes and the edges of $g'$ respectively. A graph $g$ has a partial morphism to a graph $g'$ if there are elements in $g$ without an image in $g'$.
\end{definition}
\vspace{5px}

\begin{definition}
A node or edge $\node$ in graph $g$ has an \textit{image} in graph $g'$ and $\node$ is a \textit{pre-image} of the image. For each type of node, an explanation is given  A variable $\variable \in \Variables^{\sort}, \sort \in \Sorts$, has an image $i$ in a host graph if $i \in \mathbb{U}^{\sort}$. A node $\node \in 2^\Terms$ has an image $i$ in a host graph if $i$ is the valuation of all terms in $\node$. 
\end{definition}

\vspace{5px}
\begin{definition}
A transformation rule is a tuple $\langle \mathit{LHS}, \mathit{NAC}, \mathit{RHS}, \ltsLabel \rangle$, where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\mathit{LHS}$ is a rule graph representing the left-hand side of the rule
  \item $\mathit{NAC}$ is a set of rule graphs representing the negative application conditions
  \item $\mathit{RHS}$ is a rule graph representing the right-hand side of the rule
  \item $\ltsLabel \in \Labels$ is the label of the rule
\end{itemize}
There exist implicit partial morphisms from the $\mathit{LHS}$ to each rule graph in $\mathit{NAC}$ and from the $\mathit{LHS}$ to the $\mathit{RHS}$ by means of the node identities. These morphisms are \textit{rule graph morphisms}.
\end{definition}
\vspace{5px}

\begin{definition}
A \textit{creator} edge is an edge in the $\mathit{RHS}$ of a rule, but not in the $\mathit{LHS}$ of the rule. An \textit{eraser} edge is an edge in the $\mathit{LHS}$ of a rule, but not in the $\mathit{RHS}$ or a rule.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A rule $\ggrule$ has a \textit{rule match} on a host graph $\hostGraph$ if its $\mathit{LHS}$ has a morphism in $\hostGraph$ and $\not\exists\,n \in \mathit{NAC}$ such that $n$ has a morphism in $\hostGraph$ and $\forall\,e \in \mathit{LHS}$, if $e$ has an image $i$ in $n$, and an image $j$ in $\hostGraph$, then $j$ should be an image of $i$. The morphism of the $\mathit{LHS}$ to a host graph is a \textit{match morphism}.
\end{definition}

\vspace{5px}
\begin{definition}
After the rule match is applied to the graph, all elements in $\mathit{LHS}$ that do not have an image in $\mathit{RHS}$, are removed from $\hostGraph$ and all elements in $\mathit{RHS}$ that do not have a pre-image in $\mathit{LHS}$, are added to $\hostGraph$. This process, called a \textit{rule transition}, is denoted $\hostGraph \xrightarrow{\ggrule, \rulematch}\hostGraph'$, where $\rulematch \in \RuleMatches$\newnot{symbol:RuleMatches} is the morphism of the $\mathit{LHS}$ to $\hostGraph$.
\end{definition}
\vspace{5px}

Figure \ref{fig:gg_example} shows an example of the initial graph $\startGraph$, one rule of a GG and the corresponding rule match. $\startGraph$ can be represented by $\langle\{n1,n2\},\{\langle n1,a,n1\rangle, \langle n1,A,n2\rangle,\langle n2,B,n2\rangle\}\rangle$. The $\mathit{LHS}$ of the rule has a match in $\startGraph$. Neither $\mathit{NAC1}$ and $\mathit{NAC2}$ have a match in $\startGraph$, because the edge with label $C$ does not exist in $\startGraph$. The new graph after applying the rule is $\hostGraph_1$.

\begin{definition}
A graph grammar is a tuple $\langle \Rules, \startGraph \rangle$, where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Rules$ is a set of graph transformation rules
\item $\startGraph$ is the initial graph
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\vspace{5px}

By repeatedly applying graph transformation rules to the start graph and all its consecutive graphs, a GG can be explored to reveal a \textit{Graph Transition System} (GTS). This transition system consists of graphs connected by rule transitions.

\vspace{5px}
\begin{definition}
A graph transition system is a tuple	$\langle \Graphs, \Rules, \RuleMatches, \RuleTransitions, \startGraph\rangle$, where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Graphs$\newnot{symbol:Graphs} is a set of graphs
\item $\Labels \in \Rules \times \RuleMatches$ is a set of labels
\item $\RuleTransitions \in \Graphs \times \Labels \times \Graphs$\newnot{symbol:RuleTransitions} is the rule transition relation
\item $\startGraph \in \Graphs$\newnot{symbol:startGraph} is the initial graph
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\vspace{5px}

Let $K = \langle \Rules, \startGraph$. A GTS $O = \langle \Graphs, \Rules, \RuleMatches, \RuleTransitions\rangle$ is derived from a $K$ by the following. $\Graphs, \RuleMatches, \RuleTransitions$ are the smallest sets, such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\startGraph \in \Graphs$
\item if $\hostGraph \in \Graphs$ and $\hostGraph \xrightarrow{\ggrule, \rulematch}\hostGraph'$ then $\hostGraph' \in \Graphs, (\ggrule, \rulematch) \in \Labels, (\hostGraph \xrightarrow{\ggrule, \rulematch}\hostGraph') \in \RuleTransitions$
\end{itemize}

\vspace{5px}
\begin{definition}
In order to specify stimuli and responses with GGs, a definition is given for an \textit{Input-Output GG} (IOGG). Concretely, the IOGG places input and output labels on its rule transitions. Following the definition from IOLTSs, each rule label $l \in L$ has a type $\iotype \in \IOTypes$. Exploring an IOGG leads to an \textit{Input-Output Graph Transition System} (IOGTS). The rule transitions derive their type from their corresponding rule.
