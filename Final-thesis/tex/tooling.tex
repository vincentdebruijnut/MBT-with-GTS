\subsection{ATM}\label{sec:descriptionaxini}
ATM is a web-based application, developed in the Ruby on Rails framework. It is used to test the software of several big companies in the Netherlands since 2006. It is under continuous development by Axini.

The architecture is shown graphically in Figure~\ref{fig:axini_tool}. It has a similar structure to the on-the-fly model-based testing tool architecture in Figure~\ref{fig:model_based_testing_on_the_fly}.

The tool functions as follows: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item An STS is given to an STS Engine, which passes the possible switch relations from the current state to the Test Manager.
  \item The Test Manager chooses a switch relation and the data values, based on a test strategy. In the LTS in the STS-to-LTS transformation, this choice is represented by one transition. 
  \item The label of the transition is given to the Test Execution component as an \textit{abstract stimulus}. The term abstract is used here to indicate that the transition is specific to the model. It represents some computation steps taken in the SUT. For instance, a transition with label 'connect?' is an abstract stimulus of the actual setup of a TCP connection between two distributed components of the SUT. 
  \item The translation of an abstract stimulus to a concrete stimulus is done by the Test Execution component. This component provides the stimulus to the SUT. When the SUT responds, the Test Execution component translates this response to an abstract response. For instance, the Test Execution component receives an HTTP response that the TCP connect was succesful. This is a concrete response, which the Test Execution component translates to an abstract response, such as a transition with label 'ok!'. The Test Manager is notified with this abstract response.
  \item The Test Manager updates the STS Engine on which transition was chosen as stimulus and which transition was detected based on the response of the SUT. If this latter transition is possible according to the model, the Test Manager gives a pass verdict for this test. Otherwise, the result is a fail verdict.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{GROOVE}\label{sec:descriptiongroove}
GROOVE is an open source, graph-based modelling tool in development at the University of Twente since 2004. It has been applied to several case studies, such as model transformations and security and leader election protocols~\cite{Ghamarian:GROOVE}.

The architecture of the GROOVE tool is shown graphically in Figure~\ref{fig:groove_tool}. A GTS is given as input to a Rule Applier component, which determines the possible rule transitions. An Exploration Strategy can be started or the user can explore the states manually using the GUI. These components request the possible rule transitions and respond with the chosen rule transition (based on the exploration strategy or the user input). The Exploration Strategy can do an exhaustive search, resulting in a GTiS. The graph states and rule transitions in this GTiS can then be inspected using the GUI.

%GROOVE provides parameters for the labels on the transitions in a GTiS by indicating which node(s) in a rule should be the parameter(s). 
\subsection{Comparison of the examples}\label{sec:comparison}
The models of the boardgame example in Figures~\ref{fig:example_sts} and \ref{fig:example_groove} are very different. In this section the STS and the GTS of the example are compared.

\subsubsection{Comparison of behavior}
The GTS of the boardgame example has a number of consecutive transitions when a player moves. The $move$ rule puts the \textbf{Player} on the next \textbf{Location} and lowers the remaining 'moves' by one. This is different from the STS, which updates the location variable in one transition. The effect is that the behavior of both systems is different; one specifies the movement of a \textbf{Player} as: "Player p moves to Location l", the other as: "The Player with the turn moves to the next Location". Which behavior is required when this boardgame would be tested depends on the implementation of the game. However, to show the power of the GTS formalism, Figure~\ref{fig:example_groove2} shows the GTS with the same behavior as the STS. It models the location as a variable and updates this variable in one transition. It also identifies the \textbf{Players} by giving them a number.

  \end{center}

\end{figure}

The new GTS loses many advantages by structuring it in this way: the overview of the board is gone, the rules are less visual and extending the locations in different directions is much harder. On the other hand, there are less rules and the graphs are more compact. However, when finding the GTiS corresponding to this GTS, the labels of the transitions of that GTiS do not reflect the 'move(p:N, l:N)' label of the STS. This should be done by marking the correct nodes as described in section~\ref{sec:gts_example}. The problem is that the result of the equation in the 'move' rule is only derived when the rule is applied. Figure~\ref{fig:move3} shows a rule where the equation is shown graphically. The die roll, connected by the 'throws' edge, and the number of the \textbf{Location} the \textbf{Player} is at are added. The result is represented by the \textbf{int} node connected by the 'add' edge. This result modulo 4 is represented by the \textbf{int} node connected by the 'mod' edge. This node is marked as the second parameter, the number of the \textbf{Player} is marked as the first parameter. This labels the transitions with which player moves to which location.

\subsubsection{Comparison of Transition Systems}
The GTiS of a GTS can be found using GROOVE and the STS can be transformed to an LTS. The two GTSs and the STS of the board game example result in three transition systems which can be compared.

The GTS from Figure~\ref{fig:example_groove} generates a GTiS with 32 states with 52 transitions, which can be seen visually in Figure~ \ref{fig:statespace_groove1}. The GTS from Figure \ref{fig:example_groove2}, using the 'move' rule from Figure~\ref{fig:move3}, generates 224 states with 384 transitions, shown as GTiS in Figure~\ref{fig:statespace_groove2}. The reason of the difference in number of states and transitions is that the board is circular: to the first GTS, the players being at locations 1 and 3 is the same as them being at locations 2 and 4. However, this is not the same to the second GTS. Also, for the first GTS it does not matter which \textbf{Player} node is at a \textbf{Location} node; they are the same apart from which \textbf{Player} has the 'turn'. As an example, consider the start graph in Figure~\ref{fig:example_groove}. If both players throw a '1' and move to the next location, the state is as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:symmetry_example}. Both states are symmetrical and therefore they are the same state. This leads to a \textit{symmetry reduction} of the statespace for the first GTS.

  \begin{center}
    \input{./img/start3.tikz}
  \end{center}
  \caption{An example of a state symmetrical with the state in Figure~\ref{fig:example_groove}}
  \label{fig:symmetry_example}
\end{figure}

The LTS where the STS in Figure~\ref{fig:example_sts} is transformed to has 224 states and 384 transitions. This is calculated by taking all possibilities of the data values except for the die roll. This leads to 32 states ($4 \times 4 \times 2$). These 32 'throw' states each have 6 'throw?' transitions to a 'move' state, thus there are 192 'move' states. The 'move' states only have one transition back to a 'throw' state. There are $6 \times 32 + 192 \times 1 = 384$ transitions.
