\section{Model examples}\label{sec:model-examples}

Several examples of small systems are used to validate GRATiS. Each example is modelled using a GG and an STS. The examples are:
\begin{itemize}
\item a boardgame - a game with a stochastic element
\item the farmer-wolf-goat-cabbage puzzle - a datafree puzzle with states
\item a reservation system - a system where people can make reservations for tables at a restaurant
\item a bar tab - a system where people order drinks on their tab
\item a communication protocol
\end{itemize}

In chapter~\ref{chapter:model-examples} the GG and STS for each example are given.
