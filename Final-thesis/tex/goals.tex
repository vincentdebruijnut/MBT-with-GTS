\section{Research Goals}\label{sec:goals}

The research goals are split into a design and validation component:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Design}: Design a system using ATM and GROOVE which performs model-based testing on graph grammars.
    \item \textbf{Validation}: Validate the design using case studies and performance measurements. Compare the graph grammars with symbolic models for the case studies.
\end{enumerate}

The result of the design goal will be one system called the GROOVE-Axini Testing System (GRATiS). The validation goal uses case-studies with existing specifications from systems tested by Axini. Each case-study will have a graph grammar and a symbolic model which describe the same system. GRATiS and ATM are used for the automatic test generation on these models respectively. Both the models and the test processes will then be compared as part of the validation.
