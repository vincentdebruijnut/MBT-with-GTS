\section{Research Goals}\label{sec:goals}

The research goals are split into a design and validation component:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Design}: Design and implement a system using ATM and GROOVE which performs model-based testing on graph grammars.
    \item \textbf{Validation}: Validate the design and implementation using case studies and performance measurements.
\end{enumerate}

The result of the design goal is one system called the GROOVE-Axini Testing System (GRATiS). The validation goal uses case-studies with existing specifications from systems tested by Axini. Each case-study has a graph grammar and a symbolic model which describe the same system. GRATiS and ATM are used for the automatic test generation on these models respectively. Both the models and the test processes are compared as part of the validation.
