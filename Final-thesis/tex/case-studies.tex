\section{Case Studies}\label{sec:case-studies}

Two case studies with GRATiS have been done. They are all real-life systems Axini has worked on:
\begin{itemize}
  \item a self-scan register
  \item a health-care system \marginpar{Axini: 1 case study genoeg, afronden nu}
\end{itemize}  

The self-scan register is a machine that automates the purchase of products at a supermarket. A customer can put his products on a conveyer belt and the system automatically calculates the price of the products. Then the customer pays and gets a receipt. The health-care system is a medical device.

A graph grammar and an STS are created for each system. GRATiS and ATM are used for the automatic test generation on these models respectively. Both the model and the test process are compared as part of the validation. Design issues, parts of the models and observations are noted in sections~\ref{sec:self-scan} and \ref{sec:health-care}. The objective measurments are reported in section~\ref{sec:measurements}.

\subsection{Self-scan register}\label{sec:self-scan}
Put design issues here. Parts of model if enough room?

\subsection{Health-care system}\label{sec:health-care}
Put design issues here.
