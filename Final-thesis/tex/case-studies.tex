\section{Case Study}\label{sec:case-studies}

GRATiS has been applied to a real-life system Axini has worked on: a self-scan register. The self-scan register is a machine that automates the purchase of products at a supermarket. A customer can put his products on a conveyer belt and the system automatically calculates the price of the products. Then the customer pays and gets a receipt.\marginpar{add figure of machine}.

\subsection{Model}
A graph grammar is created for the self-scan register.add rules as examples. Add isues with modelling.Observation: GG is behavior-specification, was easy to adjust model according to specification. 

\subsection{Model comparison} 
Compare with STS. Nodes-Edges vs. Nodes-Edges? Halstaed's Software science? Compare transformed STS with original STS. Differences? But: transformed STS should be exactly the same! Depends on interpretation, bad-weather testing.
