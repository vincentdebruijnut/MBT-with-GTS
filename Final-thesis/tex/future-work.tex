\section{Future work}\marginpar{dit wordt nog uitgebreid}
Better measurements should be done to evaluate model complexity.

When STSs are extended to allow more complex data structures, such as sets, maps and arrays, the way data values are viewed in GGs can also be extended.

More case studies should be done. Especially in software systems with data values.
