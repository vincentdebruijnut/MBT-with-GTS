This chapter covers the techniques used for the validation of the design. The validation is done through examples, reported in section~\ref{sec:model-examples} and a case-study, reported in section~\ref{sec:case-study}. Possible measurements on models and the performance are reported in section~\ref{sec:measurements}.
