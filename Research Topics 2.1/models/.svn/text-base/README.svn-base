This directory contains various different models / model configurations.
For them to work together with TestManager please stick to these conventions:
- compilation can be done with "mkprimer --config pos_spex.cfg pos.spex"
- the torx configuration is in pos.if

The Rake file contains a task that compiles the models in all sub dirs that
follow these conversions. Execute it by:

  rake tm:compile
