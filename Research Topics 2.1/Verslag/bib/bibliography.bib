        abstract = {This paper studies testing based on labelled transition systems, using the assumption that implementations communicate with their environment via inputs and outputs. Such implementations are formalized by restricting the class of transition systems to those systems that can always accept input actions, as in Input/Output Automata. Implementation relations, formalizing the notion of correctness of these implementations with respect to labelled transition system specifications, are defined analogous to the theories of testing equivalence and preorder, and refusal testing. A test generation algorithm is given which is proved to produce a sound and exhaustive test suite from a specification, i.e., a test suite that fully characterizes the set of correct implementations.}

          abstract = {Systematic testing is very important for assessing and improving the quality of software systems. Yet, testing turns out to be expensive, laborious, time-consuming and error-prone. The Dutch research and development project C{\^o}te de Resyste worked on methods, techniques and tools for automating specification based testing using formal methods. The main achievement of the project is a test tool, baptized TorX, which integrates automatic test generation, test execution, and test analysis in an on-the-fly manner. On the one hand, TorX is based on well-defined theory, viz. the ioco-test theory, which has its roots in the theory of testing- and refusal-equivalences for transition systems. On the other hand, the applicability of TorX has been demonstrated by testing several academic and industrial case studies. This paper summarizes the main results of the project C{\^o}te de Resyste.},
